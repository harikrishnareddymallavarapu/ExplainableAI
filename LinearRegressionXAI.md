## Partial Dependence Plots

Partial Dependence plots can be interpreted similarly to the coefficients in those models, but these plots can capture more complex patterns from the data and can be used in any data

## Interpreting Partial Dependence Plot

A partial dependence (PD) plot depicts the functional relationship between a small number of input variables and predictions. They show how the predictions partially depend on values of the input variables of interest.  For example, a PD plot can show whether the probability of flu increases linearly with fever. It can show whether high energy level will decrease the probability of having flu. PD can also show the type of relationship, such as a step function, curvilinear, linear and so on.
